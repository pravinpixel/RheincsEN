This is a big milestone for all of us.It has indeed been a long journey, starting from inception, system study, training, pilot &amp; finally the 1st month-end closing. During each stage, we received full co-operation from Rheinbrücke teams. They had given us their unwavering support, with full dedication &amp; positive attitude to make this project successful. During this entire journey, both teams faced many challenges &amp; at times, things were difficult, but both teams continued to give their focus &amp; commitment, which helped to overcome these obstacles.<br/></p></div>

Their hard work &amp; efforts, as well as the willingness to accommodate to Malaysian working hours and weekends, are much appreciated.We appreciate their flexibility &amp; accommodating to our requests, especially when we need quick &amp; urgent turnaround. This helped us resolve issues, especially during critical moments. RIC team has not only given us technical support, but also encourage us to understand the issues and how to ensure it does not repeat.Later the implementation of GST was a success, despite a very short notice from our end. RIC team has provided us with excellent technical expertise &amp; support to ensure the Epicor system is GST-ready by 1st April 2015.We truly appreciate the effort, dedication &amp; hard work from all involved.THANK YOU very much for working as a team to make these projects successful.<br />

We also faced initial hiccup and challenges during the implementations. This is where we came across the German based Rheinbrücke IT consulting and took their support. We leveraged their services for past 12 months and from this experience, I can definitely say that they did a fantastic turnaround of the project. I enjoyed the open, transparent and efficient dealing with them and came to appreciate their work. I understand that they recently started their Middle east and Africas operations, I wish them good luck and every success. "</p>
