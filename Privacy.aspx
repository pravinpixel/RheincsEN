<h3 class="redColor">Google +1</h3>
<p>Collect and share information: The Google +1 button allows you to post information worldwide. The Google + 1 button will help you and others to get personalized content from Google and our partners. Google stores both the information that you have + 1'd for a content and information about the page that you viewed when you clicked +1. Your + 1's may appear as clues along with your profile name and photo in Google services, such as in search results or in your Google profile, or elsewhere on websites and ads on the web. Google records information about your + 1 activity to improve Google's services to you and others. To use the Google + 1 button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must contain at least the name chosen for the profile. This name will be used in all Google services. In some cases, this name may also replace a different name you used when sharing content through your Google Account. The identity of your Google Profile may be displayed to users who know your email address or have other identifying information from you.</p>
<p>Use of the information collected: In addition to the uses outlined above, the information you provide will be used in accordance with the applicable Google privacy policy. Google may publish summarized statistics about users' + 1 activity or share it with users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers, or affiliate websites.</p>
