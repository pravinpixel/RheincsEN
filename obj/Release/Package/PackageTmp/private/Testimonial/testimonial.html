            Thank you for the continued good work on the ERP and Supply Chain project. Your Consulting, Technical, Functional and Project management expertise was evident and was very well appreciated by our staffs. I was also pleased with the flexible, easily approachable, transparent dealing with your team. Needless to mention I also appreciate how effectively you leverage the teaming with cross cultural teams with low cost geography for developmental resources while not compromising on the quality of deliverables to business. Keep up the good work.</p><br /><br /><img class="testimonial-img img-circle" src="/Assets/images/Testimonial/Milani.png" alt="Testimonial by Milani" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left; width: 66px; height: 67px;" /><p class="testimonial-name">Massimiliano A.

            I had been using RheinBrücke team as my extended arm for sometime now and I have really come to appreciate their depth of technical and functional knowledge of the product and their commitment to our end customers needs. They react quickly to new challenges and are always there for me to rely on.</p><br /><br /> <img class="testimonial-img img-circle" src="/Assets/images/Testimonial/craig.gif" alt="Testimonial by Craig Stephens" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left; width: 66px; height: 67px;" /><p class="testimonial-name">

            "We implemented Epicor ERP for one of our large Glass manufacturing facility in Middle East. Like any ERP implementations, even though the product was good , we faced initial hiccup and challenges during the implementation . This is where we came across the German based Rheinbrücke IT consulting and took their support. They did a fantastic turnaround of the project. I enjoyed the transparent and efficient dealing with the company and came to appreciate their work. Now they have opened the Middle East operations and am positive they will do well due to their good service motto.."<br /><br />

It was easily understood by users, so different system extension options could be evaluated with all relevant information."

            "Our challenges made us to embark on our ERP journey and after lots of analysis, we choose Epicor ERP for RAY Group. We also faced initial hiccup and challenges during the implementations. This is where we came across the German based Rheinbrücke IT consulting and took their support. We leveraged their services for past 12 months and from this experience, I can definitely say that they did a fantastic turnaround of the project. I enjoyed the open, transparent and efficient dealing with them and came to appreciate their work. I understand that they recently started their Middle east and Africas operations, I wish them good luck and every success."<br /><br /><img class=" testimonial-img img-circle" src="/Assets/images/Testimonial/vinit_agarwal.gif" alt="Testimonial by Vinit Agarwal" style="margin-right: 10px; float: left; width: 66px; height: 67px;" /><p class="testimonial-name">Vinit Agarwal<br /><span class="smaller">CEO at RAY <br /></span></p>

            NGC Energy’s Epicor Implementation go-live happened earlier this year and at the end of Jan, we had successfully closed our Jan 2015 books in Epicor.

During each stage, we received full co-operation from Rheinbrücke teams. They had given us their unwavering support, with full dedication & positive attitude to make this project successful. During this entire journey, both teams faced many challenges & at times,...
