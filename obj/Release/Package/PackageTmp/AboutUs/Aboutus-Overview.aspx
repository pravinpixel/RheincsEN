                    <p>The river Rhine is one of longest in Europe flowing through six countries: Switzerland, Principality of Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and the Netherlands before flowing into the North Sea at Rotterdam. It runs over 1,232 km from its source in the Swiss Alps, in Switzerland.</p>

                    <p>RheinBrücke – our name and our company logo reflects our vision, passion and our aspiration to be a respected player in the “SME Market”, and to be the “Go-To-Company” for IT & ERP solutions in Continental Europe. The Six dots represent the six countries that the river Rhine flows through. The Seventh dot represents the Bridge: Connectivity, a means to overcome barriers; a solid structure.</p>

                    <p class="mainContent-normal padd-bottom-10">Globalization looms over us, but we should be aware of the challenges facing us that could stop globalization in its tracks. RheinBrücke’s support of social impact work is motivated by eye-opening facts such as these. With nearly 1 billion hungry people in the world, about 21,000 children under the age of 5 died every day in 2010. The highest rates of child mortality are in sub-Saharan Africa, a rate more than 17 times the average for developed regions. More than 750 million people do not have sustainable access to safe drinking water; another 2.5 billion lack access to improved sanitation facilities.</p>

                    <p class="mainContent-normal padd-bottom-10">Against this background, the SOS Children’s Villages readily handles situations where:</p>

We are firmly convinced that together we can achieve more than any of us could individually. SOS runs over 2,300 programs catering to more than one million children and adults globally.</p>

                <p class="padd-bottom-10">SOS Family Strengthening Programs help keep children in the care of their family. Under the auspices of SOS, disadvantaged families at risk of separation are encouraged to regain their capacity to protect and care for their children.</p>
                <p class="padd-bottom-10"><b>Individual Plans for Every Child</b></p>
                <p class="padd-bottom-10">Children who cannot be cared for by their biological families are supported by family-based caregivers either with foster families or within SOS Children’s Villages. SOS families provide individualized care to promote the development, education and health of each child. They provide over 80,000 children and youth with family-based care. In partnership with communities SOS develops local infrastructure and run kindergartens, day care centres, schools, vocational training centres and medical facilities.</p>
